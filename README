strace+: An improved version of strace that collects stack traces

Copyright (c) 2011 Philip Guo <pg@cs.stanford.edu>

This project is hosted at http://code.google.com/p/strace-plus/


Quick-start guide:

1. Compile strace+

  ./configure && make

2. Compile a "hello world" test program

  gcc examples/hello.c -o hello

3. Run strace+ on 'hello' to generate a hello.out strace file

  ./strace+ -o hello.out ./hello

4. Post-process hello.out to print out a syscall trace augmented with
   stack traces (requires python >= 2.6, gdb, and file to be installed)

  python scripts/pretty_print_strace_out.py hello.out --trace

To build a 32-bit strace+ executable on an x86-64 machine, use:

  CFLAGS=-m32 ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu


strace+ is built upon strace 4.6. and libunwind 1.0

  - strace-4.6.tar.gz contains the original strace 4.6 source files.

  - libunwind-1.0.tar.gz contains the original libunwind source files.
    - The ./configure step untars and expands this file into
      libunwind-1.0/ and then 'make' will compile its contents into a
      static library

    - To get libunwind to compile on some distros, you need to use:
      ./configure CFLAGS=-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE


This is the original strace 4.6 README file:

This is strace 4.0, a system call tracer for SunOS 4.x, Linux, System
V release 4, Solaris 2.x and Irix 5.x.  strace is released under a
Berkeley-style license at the request of Paul Kranenburg; see the file
COPYRIGHT for details.

Read the INSTALL file for generic instructions on how to install
strace.  If configure cannot guess your system configuration, you can
specify it on the command line after the other options like this:

	./configure --prefix=/usr i486-linux

A single sunos4.1 binary should work on all the sun4, sun4c and sun4m
kernel architectures.  Let me know if sun4d doesn't work.  Other
i486-*-sysv4 systems may work with little or no tweaking.

See the file NEWS for information on what has changed in recent
versions.

See the file PORTING if you like strace but it doesn't work on an
operating system you use frequently.

See the file CREDITS to see who has contributed to strace.

See the file TODO if you feel like helping out.
